Some weapons within swordz are disabled by default.
I've taken the liberty of enabling the naginata (reskinned voulge)
for use on the Resurgence RP server.

The reach of the polearms in the base mod is about the same
as the longsword, which makes polearms undesirable in every
case. With some added reach, they should be a more distinct
class of weapon since as of 14/6/2024 they cannot be sharpened.
